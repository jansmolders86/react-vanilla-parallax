# Simple Implementation of Parallax

Parallax without any parallax plugins. Uses Tweenmax for animation but can easily be swapped out with a vanilla solution.

### Works with React 16+.

## Example:

## Run App
1. open command Prompt/Terminal in working directory and run: __yarn install__
2. after dependencies are installed run __yarn start__ and a browser window should pop up 'localhost:3000'

The goods are in the 'src' folder. Check out  App.js and ParallaxCard.js/sass! Enjoy!
