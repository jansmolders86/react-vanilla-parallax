# Simple Implementation of Parallax

Parallax without any parallax plugins. Uses TweenMax to animate the layers but that can easily be swapped out with another (vanilla JS) solution.

### Works with a dynamic number of layers! 

### Works with React 16+.

## Example:

## Run App
1. open command Prompt/Terminal in working directory and run: __yarn install__
2. after dependencies are installed run __yarn start__ and a browser window should pop up on page 'http://localhost:3000'
